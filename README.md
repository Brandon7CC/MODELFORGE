## MODEL FORGE
> Evaluate hosted OpenAI GPT / Google PaLM2/Gemini or local Ollama models against a task

Distribute arbitrary tasks to local or hosted language models. For example, you may want to assess how well models from Google vs. OpenAI, vs. OSS compare. Currently we support:
* OpenAI GPT models
* Google PALM2 / Gemini models via Vertex AI
* OSS models via Ollama e.g. LLaMA, Orca2, Vicuna, Mixtral8x7b, Mistral, Phi2, etc

## Example
Say you want to implement the A* search algorithm. To do so you may think through the following:
